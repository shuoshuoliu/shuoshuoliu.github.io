# About Me
* I am a PhD student in the [Statistics](https://science.psu.edu/stat) Department at the Penn State University.
* My research interests lie in the general area of machine learning, particularly in deep learning, reinforcement learning and probabilistic graphical models, as well as their applications in sequential decision making, generative modeling, multi-task and meta-learning and multi-agent systems.
